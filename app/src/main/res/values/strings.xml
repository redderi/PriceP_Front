        1. **Text search**
        The user enters a description of the item in a special field
        (for example, "white chair"). It is advisable to specify the most general classes of objects
        (for example, table, chair, chest of drawers, plate, can).
        After entering, the system will show a list of similar products found.
        \n\n
        2. **Search by photo**
        The user can take a photo or upload a photo from the gallery.
